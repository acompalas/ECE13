Andrew Rivero - attempted to debugg "stack smash detected" error but was unsuccessful
AJ - attempted to debugg "stack smash detected" error but was unsuccessful


The summary of this lab was implementing principals of matrix math into c functions which are stored in a function library then tested in a test harness.
Important aspects of the lab were having an in depth understanding of matrix math that can be broken down into algorithmic steps.
Important coding strategies used in this lab were nested for loops, proper passing by reference or by value, and proper incrementation of counters used in loops.

My approach to the lab were as follows: research about each matrix function, break function down into consecutive, and algorithmic, incrementable steps, and translate the matrix function into functioning c code. The matrix functions in C code were then later tested in the test harness using two tests per function comparing the outputs of the functions to their expected value. 
I was able to successfully complete the lab using coding strategies and c syntax presented in lectures, the lab manual, and TA sessions.
Limitations in my code regarding matrix sizes and precision are given by "DIM" and FP_DELTA" as provided in the lab files.
If I were to do this lab again, I would be more organized and efficient by using comment blocks and string storage.
Although I did not work with any other students in the class, I did consult multiple TA's to help explain C concepts as well as debugg errors.
The TA's were very helpful as they were able to help enlighten me to certain concepts as well as guide me in the proper syntax of C as opposed to other languages such as Python.

This lab took me approximately 12 hours spanning across 3 days.
I enjoyed this lab as it helped me review various matrix math concepts that would be helpful for other classes.
I did dislike the tediousness in the implementation of functions and their tests.
I would consider this lab to be worthwhile as it expanded my exposure to C syntax and helped me review coding concepts in general.
Some of the hardest parts of the lab were implementing functions in matrix math which I have forgotten requiring me to do outside research.
The point distribution was appropriate having the essential functions be worth more points and at the same time as having some of the harder functions to implement such as MatrixDeterminant() and MatrixInverse() be worth less points.
Suggestions for altering the lab would be to have a better explanation and approach to the test harness in mml.c.
Though the lab manual can be considered adequate to start off students for this lab, I think that it would be helpful to provide examples or pseudocode to encourage better code structure.
And while class examples and discussions were helpful, I do not feel they were sufficient in teaching concepts and C syntax as I had to consult TA's and the internet concerning C syntax and concepts.
Teaching more on the concepts used in this lab would be a great help to future students in this class.
