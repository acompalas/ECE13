What happens if the line “scanf(" ");” executes?  Why? - Scanf skips over white lines in code. Upon execution, it receives and reads user input, however it does not assign the input to a variable because it was not specified. Then the next line of code is executed.

In this lab, we forbid you from using printf() or scanf() inside of certain functions.  Explain why a rule like this is useful.
This rule is useful for code format in order to keep all our print statements together. It also allows us to implement if else-if statements to organize our functions and their print statements. 

How long did this lab take you?  Was it harder or easier than you expected?
This lab took me approximately two days. It took a little while to learn the different syntax, but implementing the ideas with the given code structure was fairly easy. At first the lab seemed overwhelming given the sheer amount of functions, but in the end, it was easier than expected.
