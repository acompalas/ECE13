In this lab, we learned how to combine concepts of event-driven programming, bit manipulation/bit masks, software button debouncing, interrupts, structs, and variable Scope in order to accomplish various tasks on hardware which included LEDs, OLED, buttons, and switches.
Important aspects of this lab were thoroughly understanding the concepts listed above in order to implement functions. 
I only wish that the lab manual was more specific on methods to implement these concepts instead of a general understanding. More pseudocode and detailed explanations on how these concepts are accomplished in the pseudocode would have been most helpful.

My approach to the lab consisted of completing the lab functions in consecutive blocks as listed in the lab document starting from 'Part 1.' 
Although I did read the lab manual and watch the class lectures, I was not able to fully comprehend the implementations of certain concepts within functions. The functions where I succeeded, I had a better understanding of the implementation of concepts due to the help of TA's explaning concepts during lab sessions. \
For the functions I was not able to complete, I did not have a good understanding about the flow of the code. If I were to approach this lab again, I would make sure I had a better understanding of processes before I started to code. 

By the due date of the lab, I was only able to successfully implement 3 out of the 5 functions required in the lab. 
I spent a total of 20+ hours on the lab starting from Monday night. I am disappointed of my failure to complete this lab and how it will reflect on my grades as a student. 
Although I consider this lab a worthwhile lab, I wish that were able to complete it in its entirety.
Suggestions for altering this lab would be to provide more intuitive examples and methodologies on the processes and functions in this lab.
The hardest parts of the lab were interpreting the lab document based on the information provided in the lab document and the code comments.
I only wish that I were as intelligent as some other students to independently discern the meaning of the contents of the lab documents.
Based on complexity, I deem the point distribution for grading purposes to be appropriate.
While the lab manual was partially helpful for certain functions, I found it to be insufficient to complete this lab.
I did not find the class examples to be any more helpful.
Teaching more in class lectures about material more relevant to the lab would always be a great help.

Out of the functions in this lab, I was only able to complete 'Part 1,' 'Part 2,' 'Part 3.' As for 'Part 4,' I was only able to complete it partially. And for 'Part 5' I was not able to work on it at all.
