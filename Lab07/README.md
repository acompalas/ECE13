This lab was one probably the most difficult lab that I have taken so far in this class with the exception of the last lab.
In this lab I learned how to implement the processes of an oven using a finite state machine.
Important aspects of the lab were the utilization of macros, structs, enums, and the switch case.

My approach to the lab was the same as the other labs. First, I read the lab manual and attended lab sections in order to understand the code conceptually.
Then, I read the suggested reading material in order to familiarize myself with the switch case.
For other concepts such as integer math, macros, and finite state machines, I consulted the lab manual.
And lastly, I consulted TA's and tutors for assistance with concepts and debugging.
Overall, what helped me the most in this lab was the flowchart from the lab manual outlining the oven FSM.

I implemented the lab by first including all necessary header files.
Next, I declared my structs, enums, and macros.
Finally, I implemented all lab functions and made the necessary function calls within my main.

As this lab was one of the more difficult labs, I spent a total of 20 hours or more working on this lab over the span of 5 days from Monday through Friday.
If I were to do this lab again, I would find it more doable because of the concepts I have learned.
As always, if I did have to do this lab again, I would do a more thorough reading of the lab manual.

Overall, this lab was very enjoyable and worthwhile. I feel like I have learned a lot by working on this lab.
While the lab manual could have been more clear about certain processes for specific portions, I found both the content of the lab and the point distribution based on difficulty to be very appropriate.
The hardest parts of the lab were debugging the oled output and the 'case COOKING:' for the switch state function.
In order to help future students successfully complete this lab, teaching more about the concepts contained in this lab would always be a good idea.
