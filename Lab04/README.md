Consulted TA's: Andrew Rivero, Aidan Zinn, and Eric Vetha

My general approach to the lab was to follow the RPN method described in the lab by visualizing a stack.

I simply tried my best in this lab even though the tests did not really work the right way in the end.

For example my subtraction equation was not working right. 6 4 would equal -2 but 1 4 + 6 4 - * would equal -10 intestead of 10 as intended.
Basically, my either my subtraction function had bugs or my stack methods were not working correctly.

Next time, I would approach this lab in more detail as soon as possible if I knew it would be this difficult.

I was not really able to work with other students as I live remotely. However, I was able to meet with some TA's over Zoom.

I spent at least 4 hours a day on this lab for 5 days this week. But in the end, my tests did not completely pass as intended; they only partially passed.

I do not feel successful at all. Maybe if I had more time and more guidance, I would have been able to succeed.

Though this lab was difficult, I did not dislike it.

The hardest part about this lab was getting the stack to function correctly with multiple numbers other than just two like 1 1 +.

I can only hope that I can get a good chunk of partial credit for this lab.

I tried my best in this lab. I needed all the help I could get. 

At the moment, I live remotely and am unable to attend in person labs for the majority of the week.

I only wish that I could have studied harder and gotten more help and guidance.
