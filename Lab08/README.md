Summary:

In this lab, we were taught how to read through files using the functions
fopen(), fread, and fseek() by implementing a dungeon crawler game in which
we traverse through different dungeon rooms by reading through multiple files,
Important aspects of the lab were the correct use of the functions previously
listed as well as the correct management of if-else statements as we read 
the file contents. While the lab manual gives an adequate explanation of 
reading through the lab files, diagrams from outside sources eg. Discord gave
a better explanation of traversing through the file elements.

Approach:

My approach to the lab as always began with a thorough analysis of the lab 
document. When the lab document proved insufficient for me to grasp the lab
concepts, I consulted the TA's and the discord for better insight to the lab.
After understanding the lab conceptually, I drafted and outlined pseudocode in
order to make the actual coding process easier. As I went through the lab, a
number of issues arose in debugging. However, these issues were easily solved 
by following the warnings in the terminal to pinpoint the issues. If I were to do
this lab again, I would approach it in the same way by doing thorough research and
outlining pseudocode before coding the lab.

Results:

The final results of the lab were the successful implementation of the dungeon
rooms. After compiling and debugging the lab, I had fun traversing through
the different dungeon rooms and reading the room descriptions. Overall, this was
a worthwhile lab. I think that it sufficiently taught me how to work with files
in "C" in a way that was both challenging and enjoyable. The hardest parts
of the lab were learning to use the file functions as well as the lab logic.
In accordance to difficulty, I found the point distribution to be appropriate.
While the lab manual did cover important aspects of the lab in general, it was not
very helpful with the specifics. In order to fully understand the lab, I had to 
consult external sources such as TA's, Discord, and the internet. For future labs
I think it would be best if the lab could be completed solely with information discussed
in class.
