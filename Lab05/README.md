##Timing
SelectionSort() - 50122(50.122ms)
InsertionSort() - 32610(32.61ms)

InsertionSort() was faster.

InsertionSort() is faster because it only scans as many elements as it needs to in order to place the n+1 array item while SelectionSort() scans all remaining elements to make a swap after finding the n+1 array item.

##Lab Overview
In this lab, I gained experience implementing functions for doubly linked lists. 
Important aspects of the lab were having sufficient knowledge about pointers, structs, memory allocation, sorting algorithms, and the concept of doubly linked lists. 
As in every lab, while the lab manual helped getting aquainted with certain concepts, I had to consult the class lectures, TA's, and online articles in order to fully grasp the concepts used in this lab.

My general approach to the lab was first reading the lab manual and researching the lab concepts.  
Then after getting a basic understanding of the concepts with the help of TA's, I proceeded to implement functions in the order presented in the lab document.
Testing each function in the order presented in the lab worked well for progressing through the lab at a steady pace.
The way the lab ordered the implementation and testing of functions helped tremendously in separating the work load into distinct blocks.
If I were to do this lab again, I would definitely research more about pointers and struct items as they were the source of most of the errors and warnings in my code.
Due to my remote residence status, I am unable to interact with the students in the lab who live on campus.
However, I was able to make the drive down to campus in order to get help from the TA's aside from what is available in the Zoom one on one sessions.
The TA's were very helpful in explaining concepts for this lab, especially for concepts regarding double linked lists.

This lab resulted in me successfully implementing all functions in the LinkedList.c library and the sort.c file.
I was able to run 8 total tests in order to test each of the functions in the LinkedList.c library.
All tests showed that my funtions were working as intended.
In total, I spent about 12-20 hours on this lab over the span of 4 days from Tueday through Friday.
What I liked about this lab was that I could easily visualize how the functions were working through my personally implemented tests in the LinkedListTest.c test harness.
The only thing I disliked about the lab was how lengthy it was given its difficulty. 
Overall, this lab was a worthwhile experience learning about doubly linked list and different sorting algorithms.
Suggestions on improving the lab would be to include lecture examples that are directly relevant to the lab by providing similar examples to situations that students might come across in the lab with specific examples demonstrating c syntax.
The hardest parts of the lab by far were correctly configuring and connecting the doubly linked lists all while keeping track of pointers.
As for grading, the point distribution seemed appropriate considering the many functions that had to be implemented.
While the lab manual helped in getting aquainted with concepts, it was not entirely sufficient.
As for class examples, I think that it would help providing better examples of syntax that would be directly relevant to the lab material rather than just a broad explanation.
In other words, it would be preferable if the class lectures and lab were more interconnected.
What helped the most above the lab lectures were the TA's who helped visualize the specifics of the lab in greater detail by explaining both concepts and syntax.
